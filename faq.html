    <h1>Faqs</h1>

    <p>I'm sure you have many questions, so let's go!</p>

    <h2>Can others see what I write?</h2>
    <p>Nope, no chance. Unless they find your key. Keep it safe! Create a new key if yours has been compromised.</p> 

    <h2>Can you see what I write?</h2>
    <p>Nope! My code is on github for anyone to look at. It's a static website and only stores data locally on your pc,
        using localStorage
        (see
        below).</p>

    <h2>What's localStorage?</h2>
    <p>It's a safe way of storing data in your browser, that no one else can get access to (unless of course you have
        viruses...). Though as the name implies, data is locally stored, so if you want to use multiple devices, you
        need to
        set up your keys on all of them. But you only need to do this once (phew).</p>

        <p>Click here to see how to get set up.</p>

    <h2>Can I delete my data?</h2>
    <p>Sure! You can delete your keys and chats on their individual pages, or below to bulk delete.</p>

    <p>key(s) stored: 0</p>
    <button>Delete all keys</button>
    <p>chat(s) stored: 0</p>
    <button>Delete all chats</button>
    <p>Please refresh page</p>

    <h2>If his website gets hacked, can they take any sensitive data?</h2>
    <p>Nope, and even if it was hacked, they wouldn't find anything interesting. I'm running this website "statically",
        away from databases.</p>


    <h2>Eh?</h2>
    <p>There is nothing secretive about static websites. What you see if what you get. There's no "back-end", so there's
        no
        dodgy business going on. There are also no "cookies" (sad face) . Check out the code on github if you're still
        not
        convinced.</p>
